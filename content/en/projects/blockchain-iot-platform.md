## Overview

Innovative platform that combines blockchain technology with the Internet of Things to create a decentralized ecosystem for device management.

## Challenge

Develop a solution that enables secure and decentralized management of thousands of IoT devices, ensuring data integrity and transaction transparency.

## Solution

<StatGrid />

We implemented a hybrid architecture that combines:

- **Smart Contracts** in Solidity for business logic
- **Laravel Backend** for RESTful APIs
- **Vue.js Frontend** with Nuxt for user interface
- **MQTT Protocol** for IoT device communication
